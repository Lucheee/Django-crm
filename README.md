# Django-crm

Django CRM is a simple CRM application that performs the CRUD operations by allowing customers create their records and also update, read or delete the records.

You can get started by running the git clone command in your terminal <strong> "git clone  https://github.com/Lucheee/Django-crm.git </strong>" and opening the folder.

Then, create a virtual environment, after it has been activated, install the requirements file by running <strong> "pip install -r requirements.txt"</strong>.

After doing this, you can then run the app by running this <strong> "python manage.py runserver"</strong> and follow the link in the terminal.

You should see this:
